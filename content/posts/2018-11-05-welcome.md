The plan for the reading group is to discuss novel ideas and theories that match the interests of the group. We will start with computational evolution theory. The provisional list of topics to come are

*  Theo's intro to Biology
* Bayesian cognition theory 
* Random matrix theory
* Bayesian computation/learning theory 
* Functional programming (take a look at [this website](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters) for an idea)
