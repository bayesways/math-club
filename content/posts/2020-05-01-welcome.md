The plan for this group is to discuss scientific ideas and theories (old and new) that match the interests of the group. I imagine it will work a bit like a reading club where everyone reads the assigned reading ahead of the discussion. Below I will maintain a running list of potential topics to come:

* [Stephen Wolfram's new physics](/post/stephen-wolfram-s-new-physics/) (start with this topic?)
* [Computational Evolution Theory](/post/evolution-theory-and-complexity/)
* Theo's intro to Biology
* Bayesian cognition theory 
* Random matrix theory
* Stephen Wolfram's new physics (see [here](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/))
* Kevin Buzzards new proof language system [videp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZHbnQlFOn4) [site](https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean/index.html)
* Functional programming (take a look at [this website](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters) for an idea)
