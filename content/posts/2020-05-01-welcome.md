The plan for this group is to discuss scientific ideas and theories (old and new) that match the interests of the group.
Below I will maintain a running list of potential topics to come:

* [Computational Evolution Theory](/2020/05/05/computational-evolution-theory/)
* Theo's intro to Biology
* Bayesian cognition theory 
* Random matrix theory
* Bayesian computation/learning theory 
* Functional programming (take a look at [this website](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters) for an idea)
