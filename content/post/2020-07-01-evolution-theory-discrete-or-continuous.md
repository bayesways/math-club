Papadimitriou makes a comment on his [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WoamKUfisVM) about the status of Evolution theory in the early 1900's. On the one side we have the Mendellian evolution theory, which is based on discrete categories, based largely on his experiments. He found that heredity shows up in distinct categories, either yellow or blue let's say. 

On the other hand, Darwin's theory is more about a continuous change in the species, so slow that is hardly visible. 

Reconciling the two theories is not simple and it was the product of three figures in statistics, Fisher, Wright and Haldane during 1920-50 to bridge the gap. The story is told in the section "Sidebar: The Equation that Reconciled Darwin and Mendel" of this [article](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/11/209128-sex-as-an-algorithm/fulltext).
