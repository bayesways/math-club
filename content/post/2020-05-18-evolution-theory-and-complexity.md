**Logistics** : The discussion will be held on Saturday 5/30/20 at 14:00 EST (19:00 UK or 11:00 PST). Same zoom link as last time. 
Keep notes/questions/ideas. See you there!

We will discuss the "Multiplicative weights" algorithm and their applications. 
One interesting application is the papers by Papadimitirou (in what I think is described as computational evolution theory).  
I think it would be interesting if everyone brought their own favorite application of the algorithm to the discussion.

His work (if I remember correctly) shows how the MW algorithm can explain three fundemental questions left unanswered by traditional Evolution Theory: 

* How does novelty arise in organisms? 
* What is the role of sex?
* How is variability preserved despite constant mixing?

His work I think gave rise to other research projects, I saw him talk at the Simons Insitute in New York. I think he gave the same talk around different univerisities, see this [video lecture](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/11/209128-sex-as-an-algorithm/abstract) 
and an extended version ([part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwMiODT5qPU), [part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFXRApGW_Lw))
